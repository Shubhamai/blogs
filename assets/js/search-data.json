            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a ‚Äúlevel 1 heading‚Äù in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here‚Äôs a footnote 1. Here‚Äôs a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here‚Äôs a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .

I have been Machine learning since more than a year, and currently, making all sorts of projects and products with Machine learning, Deep Learning, computer vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning and possibly Natural Language Processing, and of course, deploying them into the cloud for the world . I started programming way back when I was 14, playing with electronics and micro-controllers including Arduino, Raspberry PI, servo, LED üí°, and much more. Then it was time to upgrade, so I started learning Python and there was a lot of fun to learn a new programming language, I started learning Machine Learning way back when I was 15 years old, with Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and little Reinforcement Learning. . Currently, I have been working Self Paid and Teaching Assistant at Zero to Mastery. Helping students who are just getting started into Machine Learning &amp; AI. .
